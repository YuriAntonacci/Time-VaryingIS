# Time-VaryingIS
This Matlab toolbox allows for the identification of an autoregressive (AR) model through the recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm, providing a time-specific estimation of the innovation variance and AR model parameters when the stationarity assumption cannot be fulfilled [1]. Subsequently, by employing a recursive solution of the Yule-Walker equations, an estimation of the process variance [2] and, by assuming Gaussianity, it becomes possible to derive information-theoretic measures from the autoregressive analysis of the analyzed process [3]. In this work, we focus on the analysis of Information Storage (IS), which represents the information content of a complex system.
